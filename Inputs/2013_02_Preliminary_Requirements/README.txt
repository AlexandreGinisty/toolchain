The documents in this folder represent the result of the high-level review of the WP2 preliminary requirements.  These are "snapshots" to document the state of things at one point in time: February 14, 2013, 22:20 CET.

Summary of Review
-----------------

The overall response is a "weak accept" (1.0).  Chapter 7 and 8 are the most critical chapters at this point, which got rated slightly better than "borderline" (0.4 and 0.6, respectively). Chapter 9 and 10 are also below "weak accept" (both 0.7).  The remaing chapters are 6 (1.1) and 5 (1.4).

There is a lot of constructive feedback in the response document.

In summary, the deliverable provides WP7 with an acceptable foundation for the ongoing activities.
