\paragraph{Abstract} Short abstract on the approach and tool 
SysML \cite{SysML} is a graphical language that extends UML for a customize
version suitable for system engineering. It may help modeling system within a board range of
system variety that may include hardware, software, data, personnel and facilities. It supports the
specification, analysis design, verification and validation of complex system.

Enterprise architect (EA) version 9.3 \cite{website} has been used to implement
the model. EA provides SysML and UML modeiling capabilities.
EA is a visual platform for designing and constructing
software systems, for business process modeling, and for more generalized modeling purposes. it
covers all aspects of the development cycle. The main advantages is the requirement management
and tracing, the team work and the include versionning. The main cons : it is not an open source
tool.

\section{Main usage of the approach}
\label{main_usage}
This section discusses the main usage of the approach.

According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, for which phases do you recommend the approach (give a note from 0 to  3) :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}

\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
Enterprise architect is able to generate C, java ... code from the UML/SysML
representation. This capability has not been tested by me. Moreover
from the serialized form of the model (xmi) it is possible to use
other tool to perform different task including code gneration.
\end{author_comment}
According to the figure \ref{fig:main_process}, for which type of activities do you recommend the approach (give a note from 0 to  3) :

\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
As said before, the model from enterprise architect may be imported
with a bit of effort (adapt parser to EA xmi) into other tools or some
tool may be plugged to EA. The model may be then used for the
different tasks of the table.
\end{author_comment}


\paragraph{Known usages} Have you some examples of usage of this
approach to  compare with the OpenETCS objectives ?

Plenty of experiences using SysML or UML in embedded system may be
found, the reader may refer to the proceeding of international
conference such as : Conference on Systems Engineering
Research (CSER), International Conference on Model-Based Systems Engineering
(MBSE), Embedded realtime software and systems (ERTS).
 

\section{Language}
This section discusses the main element of the language.

Which are the main characteristics of the language :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline 
Informal language & 0 & & &  \\

\hline
Textual language & 1 & & & \\
\hline
Mathematical symbols or code &1 &  & & \\
\hline
Graphical language &3 & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

According WP2 requirements, give a note for the capabilities of the language (from 0 to 3) :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline

\hline

\hline
Extensible language (D.2.6-01-28) &3 & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}


\paragraph{Documentation} 
SysML is  defined and standardized by OMG. They provide a complete
definition of the language and a guideline on the methodology
\cite{SysML}. The serialized form (the textual representation of the
graphical model) is also defined and standardized by OMG (see the XMI
definition).

Enterprise architect gives tutorial and sample model to start
with. The tool is really easy to use.

\paragraph{Language usage} 
SysML is dedicated on system engineering and suitable for a board range of
system variety. Using stereotype and profile the language may be
extended and customized according to the user need following the
specific domain of the modeled system.


\section{System Analysis}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for system analysis.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Acoording WP2 requirements, how the approach can be involved for the sub-system requirement specification ?

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline

\hline
Traceability with Safety activities (D.2.6-X-11)  &3 & & &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
  SysML proposes a choice of diagrams to describes the system or the
  software under consideration. It is then possible to represent the
  system at different level of abstraction. Moreover one of the main
  addition of SysML compare to UML is the requirement diagram that
  makes the link between the model and the requirements.
\end{author_comment}


\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Two kinds of model can be planned during this phase: semi-formal models to  cover the SSRS (D.2.6-X-12.1) and strictly formal  models to  focuss on some functional and safety aspects (D.2.6-X-14).  Obviously some strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formal  model.

\subsection{Semi-formal model}

Concerning semi-formal model, how the WP2 requirements are covered ?

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline

\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
The link with the SSRS may be really easy if the SSRS is modeled
with SysML.

For the coverage, I do not know and I did not try.


Simulation,animation  and execution may be done by additional plug-in
or by different tools.
\end{author_comment}
Concerning safety properties management, how the WP2 requirements are covered ?

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}

\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{author_comment}
SysML formalism may be used to add constraints representing assertion
or properties. This can then be check by plug-in or external tools
During the modeling activities I did not try these requirements, I can
not say much about it.
\end{author_comment}
Does the language allow to  formalize (D.2.6-X-31):

\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} Do you think your semi-formal  model is sufficient to cover a safe design of the on-board unit until code generation ?
All comments on links to  other models, validation and verification activities are welcomed.
\begin{author_comment}
SysML \cite{sysmlbook} is a good candidate for theses purposes.
\end{author_comment}

\begin{author_comment}

The formal semantics of SysML is described in textual form in the UML and SysML standards
(see \url{http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.3/Superstructure/PDF/}, \url{http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/1.2/PDF/})

The Chapters about State Machines in the UML
document gives a rather clear description (thought not really easy
to read ...) about the intended behaviors of state machines and the
semantic variation points that are NOT fixed by the standard, but may
be interpreted in different ways. More mathematical descriptions can
be found in  many research papers.
\end{author_comment}
\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} Do you think your strictly formal  model can be directly defined from the SSRS ?
All comments on links to  other models, validation and verification activities are welcomed.

\begin{author_comment}
SysML is a good candidate for these purposes
\end{author_comment}

\begin{author_comment}
SysML is a modeling language, it can also be used to design
software. EA first purpose is not to provide a software development
infrastructure. This can be realized through plug-in or with external
tools.
EA itself does not provide mechanism for error detecting code ...
