\paragraph{Abstract} The B-Method is a formal method developed by J-R. Abrial and used in industry, especially in railroad industry, to develop complex systems. It covers software development from formal specifications to code level. Proof mechanisms guaranty the consistency of specifications properties and the complete consistency of code regarding its formal specification. It is efficient to model  functional  elements of a critical software with respect to  EN50128 contraints.
