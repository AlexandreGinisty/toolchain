\paragraph{Abstract} 

The B-Method is a formal method developed by J-R. Abrial and used in industry, especially in railway industry, to develop complex systems. It covers software development from formal specification to code level. Proof mechanisms guaranty the consistency of specifications properties and the complete consistency of code regarding its formal specification. It is efficient to model  functional  elements of a critical software with respect to  EN50128 constraints.

AtelierB is the industrial  tool the most used to develop critical software.

\begin{author_comment}
Classical B can be used for system design, however it is most adapted to software design. Event-B  based on the same language is better for system analyses \ref{chap:eventB}.

\paragraph{Known usages} Have you some examples of usage of this approach to  compare with the OpenETCS objectives ?

\begin{author_comment}

Classical B has been used successfully  in railway  industry (mainly by Alstom, Siemens and AREVA) to  develop critical software in urban (CBTC, PMI,...) and mainline domains (KVB, Eurobalise,...). Hundred of different systems are running in the world embedding software developed in B (see \url{http://www.cs.vu.nl/~wanf/pubs/handbookFFM.pdf}, \url{http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48119-2_22} and \url{http://web.tiscali.it/chiccoterri/Metod B.htm}).

It is also used in nuclear, aeronautic and defence area.

\section{System Analysis}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for system analysis.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Acoording WP2 requirements, how the approach can be involved for the sub-system requirement specification ?

\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
Classical B can be used to  support partly  system analysis. However Event B, based on the same language, is more suitable \ref{chap:eventB}.
\end{author_comment}

\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Two kinds of model can be planned during this phase: semi-formal models to  cover the SSRS (D.2.6-X-12.1) and strictly formal  models to  focuss on some functional and safety aspects (D.2.6-X-14).  Obviously some strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formal  model.

\subsection{Semi-formal model}
