\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Two kinds of model can be planned during this phase: semi-formal models to  cover the SSRS (D.2.6-X-12.1) and strictly formal  models to  focuss on some functional and safety aspects (D.2.6-X-14).  Obviously some strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formal  model.
