\paragraph{Abstract} Short abstract on the approach and tool (10 lines max)

The formal language Event-B is based on a set-theoretic approach. It is a variant of the B
language, with a focus on system level modeling and has also be defined by  Jean-Raymond Abrial. An Event-B model is separated into a static
and a dynamic part.

Rodin is an industrial strength formal modeling tool. It allows for the application of the Event-B approach to formal systems modeling. It provides proof obligation creation for invariants, refinement relations and data types. It comprises an Eclipse based modeling framework and supports numerous plugins, e.g., graphical modeling (iUML), automated proof support (theorem provers, SMT solvers) and traceability of requirements (ProR). It was developed by various academic and industrial partners in the European Union Projects RODIN (2003-2007), DEPLOY (2008-2012) and currently ADVANCE (2011-2014).

Does the tool allow to simulate or to debbug step by step a model or a code ?

Two plug-ins (ProB and animateB) are currently existing to simulate and animate the event-b model.
