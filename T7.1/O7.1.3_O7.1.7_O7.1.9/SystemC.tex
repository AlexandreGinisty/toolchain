\section{Presentation}

This section gives a quick presentation of the approach and the tool.

\begin{description}

\paragraph{Abstract} 

SystemC is a C++ library providing an event-driven simulation interface suitable for electronic system level design. It enables a system designer to simulate concurrent processes. SystemC processes can communicate in a simulated real-time environment, using channels of different datatypes (all C++ types and user defined types are supported). SystemC supports hardware and software synthesis (with the corresponding tools). SystemC models are executable.

\section{Main usage of the approach}
\label{main_usage}

SystemC is suitable for system level design at various abstraction levels (from high level down to individual hardware components) and can thus be employed to build a full system model. Due to its modular design and abstraction priciples sub-components and a lower abstraction level of the model can be considered as ``black boxes''. SystemC models can be executed and simulated allowing for testing of the entire model or individual components.

\section{Language}
This section discusses the main element of the language.

Which are the main characteristics of the language :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline 
Informal language &0 & & &  \\

\hline
Textual language &3 & & & \\
\hline
Mathematical symbols or code &2** & & & \\
\hline
Graphical language &* & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
* We would set this to 2, because there are languages where you can write the mathematical formula directly like in written text. 
** Not graphical, but we are investigating SystemC and UML/SysML integration, the \href{http://www.martes-idea.org/}{ITEA MARTES Project} is addressing this aspect
\end{author_comment}

According to WP2 requirements, give a note for the capabilities of the language (from 0 to 3) :

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline
& \textcolor{green}{Author} & \textcolor{blue}{Assessor 1} & \textcolor{magenta}{Assessor 2} & Total \\
\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
* Should be two rows. SystemC provides simulation but not animation.
\end{author_comment}


\paragraph{Documentation} Describe how the language is documented, the existing guidelines, coding rules, standardization...

There is an IEEE Standard covering SystemC, an official specification from the Accellera Initiative and a plethora of third party literature and tutorials.

\paragraph{Language usage} Describe the possible restriction on the language

\begin{itemize}
\item As the language is based on C++ and thus inherits its expressivity there might be problems in static analysis if the models use the power of the language in an unrestricted manner.
\item The language is text-based and not graphical. However, there are approaches of integrating SystemC and UML/SysML. We are currently investigating in this issue.
\end{itemize}


\section{System Analysis}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for system analysis.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

According WP2 requirements, how the approach can be involved for the sub-system requirement specification ?

\begin{author_comment}
This is not the main purpose of SystemC. Thus we skip this section.
\end{author_comment}

\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Two kinds of model can be planned during this phase: semi-formal models to  cover the SSRS (D.2.6-X-12.1) and strictly formal  models to  focuss on some functional and safety aspects (D.2.6-X-14).  Obviously some strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formal  model.

\subsection{Semi-formal model}

Concerning semi-formal model, how the WP2 requirements are covered ?

\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
* The coverage has to be achieved by the \textbf{model}, not by the language or tool and should be removed from the table.\\
** See table above\\
*** What are ``exported requirements''?\\
**** This cannot be extracted from the requirement as the requirement is on execution which is in the next row.
\end{author_comment}

Concerning safety properties management, how the WP2 requirements are covered ?

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}
\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
* Item not clear to me, should be a requirement for the actual implementation, not a model
\end{author_comment}

Does the language allow to  formalize (D.2.6-X-31):

\begin{tabular}{|l | c | c | c | c|}

\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Additional comments on semi-formal  model} Do you think your semi-formal  model is sufficient to cover a safe design of the on-board unit until code generation ?
All comments on links to  other models, validation and verification activities are welcomed.

\subsection{Strictly formal model}

\begin{author_comment}
Not filled, since we do not consider SystemC to be a strictly formal modelling language, as it has no mathematically formalized sematics. Fully formal models should also support ``really'' formal verification (not only testing) which requires additional work here. However, there are many approaches in the literature to, e.g., apply model checking to SystemC models.
\end{author_comment}


\paragraph{Additional comments on strictly formal  model} Do you think your strictly formal  model can be directly defined from the SSRS ?
All comments on links to  other models, validation and verification activities are welcomed.


\section{Software design}

\end{tabular}

\begin{author_comment}
  * Unclear to me\\
  ** Not directly; by means of external tools such as Doxygen (or in the case of issue tracking, e.g., GitHub)\\
 *** By means of versioning systems such as Git or SVN\\
**** For SystemC text-based version control is equivalent to model-based version control.\\
***** Can possibly be covered by an associated SysML model. In addition, standardised, machine readable comments in the code could be used.\\
****** Tool chain integration can be achieved at different levels. E.g., SystemC can be the target language from graphical, higher-level languages (e.g., SysML). SystemC models are executable and thus code generation is possibly no issue if we want to obtain just an executable model but no real code running on the target platform (which is out of scope for openETCS).

\section{Certifiability}

This section discusses how the tool can be classified according EN50128 requirements (D.2.6-X-50).
