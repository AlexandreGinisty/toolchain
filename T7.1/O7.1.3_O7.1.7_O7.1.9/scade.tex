\paragraph{Abstract} Short abstract on the approach and tool (10 lines max)

SCADE is a formal modelling language targeted for safety-critical embedded control applications
in the avionics, rail, automotive and industrial automation domain. SCADE source code can be
written as text (for anyone who likes writing plain text) or (more usual) as schematic diagrams.

SCADE models are synchronously clocked data flow and state machines, that can be nested
and intermixed with each other without limitations. SCADE provides DO-178B- and EN50128-
certified code generators producing C or ADA code as output. SCADE models are therefore concrete, deterministic, executable and verifiable; it allows the production of rapid prototype as
well as of safety related target system software.

SCADE comes with an integrated development environment (SCADE Suite IDE) including
code generator, graphical simulator, model checker/prover, model test coverage analyzer, report
generators, version and requirements management gateway with interfaces to various other tools
like static code and timing analyzers, System/SysML modelling tools etc.. The IDE provides
automatization interfaces to be controlled from external tools, and all SCADE tools itself can
also be used in batch mode. In addition, plugins for Eclipse integration are available.

The SCADE paradigm of synchronously clocked data flow and state machines works perfect for
embedded control or industry automation software. It is less suitable for tasks like text processing
or computer graphic applications. SCADE models do not only describe the structure of software;
instead, they are the software implementation itself too. System architectures typically require a
higher abstraction means of description at top level like SysML. While SysML modelling can
be achieved with any SysML tools, SCADE System provides an automatic transformation from
SysML to SCADE.

\begin{author_comment}
SCADE can be used for analyzing tasks on system level, especially to clarify complex system behaviour and functions by practical modelling, execution, simulation and test. For a higher abstraction level, this should be enhanced with system modelling languages as SysML.

\begin{author_comment}
SCADE is a strictly textual and graphical formal language. It allows to be extended with user-defined operators. Especially the graphical representation is easy to learn and understand; nevertheless the rich tool suite covering most aspects of a EN50128 compliant process causes an appropriate learning effort by amount.

\end{author_comment}


\section{Sub-System formal design}
This section discusses the usage of the approach for sub-system formal design.
It can be skipped depending the results of \ref{main_usage}.

Two kinds of model can be planned during this phase: semi-formal models to  cover the SSRS (D.2.6-X-12.1) and strictly formal  models to  focuss on some functional and safety aspects (D.2.6-X-14).  Obviously some strictly  formal means can be used to define the semi-formal  model.

\subsection{Semi-formal model}
